# Dog Tracking Project
1. Built an end-to-end computer vision system using Google Cloud Pub/Sub and the Nest SDM API to stream and process 1000s real-time camera events daily for indoor dog tracking.
2. Trained and refined a custom YOLOv8 model, improving accuracy from 30% to 90%.
3. Integrated with Label Studio for easy labelling and automated model retraining with Jenkins pipelines, enabling accurate pet monitoring and automated model improvement.
