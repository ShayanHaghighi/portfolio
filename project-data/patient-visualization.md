Built during a 12-hour hackathon, this project focused on enabling clinicians to manage
and visualise patient data efficiently. The application integrated a 3D lesion viewer
using Three.js and data-driven dashboards with ApexCharts to summarise patient statistics.
Presented the solution in a live pitch and placed 2nd out of 44 participants.
