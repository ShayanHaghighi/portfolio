Verbatim is a real-time multiplayer game where users compete to guess which of their
friends said a given quote. The frontend is built with React and the backend with Flask,
connected via WebSockets for instant, bidirectional communication. This setup ensures
live updates and fast-paced gameplay similar to popular quiz apps.
