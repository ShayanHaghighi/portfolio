This project implements a complete chess engine using the python-chess library for move
logic and Pygame for the user interface. It features iterative deepening, transposition
tables, and move ordering to enhance performance. The engine utilises the minimax
algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to evaluate moves efficiently, balancing computational
depth with time constraints.
