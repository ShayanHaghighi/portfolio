This project implements a complete chess engine using the python-chess library for move
logic and Pygame for the user interface. 

It features:
- iterative deepening
- transposition tables
- move ordering to enhance performance 
- search tree pruning

The engine utilises the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to evaluate moves efficiently, balancing computational
depth with time constraints.
